# Text-Based-Shooter
It's a Simple Shooter that's Text-Based.

Released as a .bat file, therefore requiring a Windows PC in order to run.

Feel free to download the source, if you like extremely unstable builds.

# Compiling
Compliling is unnecessary, as all you need to do is download or clone the .zip and would have access to unstable builds.

If you want a partially stable build, check the "Releases" tab.
